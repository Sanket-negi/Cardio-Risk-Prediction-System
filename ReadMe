Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction and intervention can significantly reduce mortality rates. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular events based on various health metrics and demographic data.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key features:

-Demographic Data: Age, Gender
-Health Metrics: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, body mass index (BMI)
-Lifestyle Information: Smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity
-Target Variable: Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease

The data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and scaling before model training.

Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


 Steps Involved
# Data Loading

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and preprocessing.

# Data Cleaning

- Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
- Removing or treating outliers using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
- Encoding categorical variables to prepare them for model training.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing data distributions and relationships using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

# Feature Engineering

- Normalizing and scaling numerical features to ensure model stability.
- Creating new features based on domain insights to enhance model performance.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets for unbiased evaluation.

# Model Training and Evaluation

- Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
- Using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize model performance.
- Evaluating models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

# Results
The project achieves the following outcomes:

- Performance metrics for each model.
- Identification of the most important features contributing to the predictions.



# Conclusion

The project demonstrates a practical approach to predicting cardiovascular risk using machine learning. The insights derived can guide healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention strategies. Future work can explore deep learning models or incorporate additional features to improve predictive accuracy.
